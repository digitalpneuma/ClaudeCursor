# AI Consultancy Website Development Plan

## 1. Overview and Goals
This document outlines a complete plan for building a professional website for an AI consultancy focused on helping small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) integrate AI technologies. The core services include assistance with video and image prompts, building low to mid-level apps marketed as "junior-ish software development" (branded as Vibe Coding in the future, but not yet emphasized).

**Primary Goals:**
- Showcase expertise in AI integration to attract SMB clients.
- Differentiate from generic AI competitors by emphasizing personalized, human-AI hybrid approaches, unique storytelling, and non-cookie-cutter design.
- Provide an engaging, interactive user experience that demonstrates AI value without overwhelming visitors.
- Optimize for conversions: inquiries, consultations, and service sign-ups.

**Unique Selling Proposition (USP):** Position the consultancy as a "vibe-driven" AI partner that blends creative intuition with technical prowess, avoiding the sterile, mass-produced feel of AI-generated sites. Use custom elements like hand-drawn AI-inspired illustrations and interactive demos that feel personal and approachable.

## 2. Target Audience
- SMB owners and decision-makers in industries like retail, marketing, healthcare, and e-commerce.
- Non-technical users seeking practical AI solutions without deep expertise.
- Budget-conscious clients looking for affordable, scalable AI integrations (e.g., prompt engineering, simple app development).

## 3. Website Structure and Key Features
The site will be a single-page application (SPA) with smooth navigation for a modern feel, divided into sections. Avoid traditional multi-page sites to stand out.

**Sections:**
- **Hero/Home:** Dynamic header with a custom AI-generated (but human-refined) animation showing AI transforming a business workflow. Tagline: "Unlock AI's Vibe for Your Business – Personalized, Powerful, Practical."
- **Services:** Interactive cards with hover effects revealing case studies. Services include:
  - Video/Image Prompt Engineering: Custom prompts for tools like Midjourney or Stable Diffusion.
  - App Development: "Junior-ish" software using no-code/low-code platforms like Bubble or Adalo, branded as Vibe Coding.
  - AI Integration Consulting: Audits, strategy sessions, and implementation.
- **About Us:** Storytelling section with founder bio, emphasizing human touch in AI. Include a timeline of AI milestones personalized to the consultancy's journey.
- **Case Studies/Portfolio:** Carousel of real (or hypothetical) client stories with metrics (e.g., "Increased efficiency by 40% via AI prompts").
- **Blog/Resources:** Educational content on AI tips, avoiding generic advice – focus on niche SMB challenges.
- **Contact/Consultation:** Dedicated form for requesting a free AI business audit, integrated with an optional AI-powered chatbot for initial queries (using something like Dialogflow for a non-generic feel). The form includes fields for first name, last name, company name, what the company does, email, and telephone number. It features a prominent "AUDIT MY BUSINESS" button (all caps, styled as a shiny green CTA with subtle glow effects for a premium feel).
- **Footer:** Links, privacy policy, and a subtle AI Easter egg (e.g., a prompt generator tool).

**Unique Features:**
- Interactive AI Demo: A mini-tool where users input a business problem and get a customized prompt suggestion.
- Custom Illustrations: Hand-drawn style AI elements (e.g., via Procreate + AI upscaling) to avoid stock images.
- Dark Mode Toggle: With a "Vibe Switch" that changes the site's energy (e.g., calm blues to vibrant purples).
- Audit Form Mock-Up: Non-functional backend but fully styled front-end with validation (e.g., required fields) to demonstrate user flow during development.

## 4. Technology Stack (How to Build It)
Build a fast, scalable site using modern tools for efficiency and uniqueness. Avoid generic templates like WordPress themes; opt for custom development.

**Frontend:**
- Framework: Next.js (for SEO-friendly React app with server-side rendering).
- Styling: Tailwind CSS with custom extensions for unique components (e.g., animated gradients).
- Interactivity: Framer Motion for animations, avoiding overused libraries like GSAP for a fresh feel.

**Backend (if needed):**
- For forms/chatbot: Supabase or Firebase for lightweight database and auth.
- AI Integration: OpenAI API for demo features, with custom wrappers to personalize outputs.

**Development Tools:**
- Version Control: Git (host on GitHub).
- Deployment: Vercel for seamless Next.js hosting.
- Testing: Cypress for E2E tests, ensuring cross-browser compatibility.
- Performance: Optimize with lazy loading, image compression (via Next.js Image), and Lighthouse scores >90.

**Build Process:**
1. **Planning/Design (1-2 weeks):** Wireframes in Figma, focusing on non-linear layouts (e.g., asymmetric grids).
2. **Setup (1 week):** Initialize Next.js project, configure Tailwind, set up repo.
3. **Development (2-3 weeks):** Build sections iteratively, starting with Hero and Services.
4. **Integration (1 week):** Add AI demo and backend if needed.
5. **Testing/Optimization (1 week):** Bug fixes, performance tweaks, mobile responsiveness.
6. **Launch:** Deploy to Vercel, set up domain, analytics (e.g., Google Analytics with custom events).

**Budget Considerations:** Aim for low-cost tools (free tiers of Vercel/Supabase). If outsourcing, focus on freelancers skilled in Next.js for custom work.

## 5. Design Guidelines
To achieve a world-class, non-generic look:
- **Overall Style:** Minimalist with a twist – clean lines but with organic, wavy elements inspired by AI neural networks. Avoid flat design; use subtle 3D effects (e.g., via Spline for interactive elements).
- **Typography:** Primary: Inter (modern sans-serif). Secondary: A custom or less common font like Space Grotesk for headings to stand out. Font sizes: 16px base, with generous spacing.
- **Layout:** Asymmetric grids, full-width sections with parallax scrolling for depth. Mobile-first design.
- **Icons/Graphics:** Custom SVG icons with AI motifs (e.g., stylized neurons). No Font Awesome – create or commission unique ones.

**Color Palette:**
Inspire trust and innovation while being unique. Base on a "Cosmic Vibe" theme: Deep space blues with energetic accents, avoiding overused tech blues.

- Primary: #1A237E (Indigo Night) – For backgrounds and CTAs.
- Secondary: #651FFF (Electric Violet) – For highlights and interactive elements.
- Accent: #00E5FF (Neon Cyan) – For AI-related features.
- Neutral: #F5F5F5 (Light Gray) for text backgrounds, #121212 for dark mode.
- Success/Error: #4CAF50 (Green) and #FF5252 (Red), but with gradients for uniqueness (e.g., linear-gradient from violet to cyan).

**Schema/Branding Rules:**
- Use gradients sparingly but impactfully (e.g., button hovers).
- Accessibility: WCAG AA compliant – high contrast ratios (e.g., white text on indigo >4.5:1).
- Non-Generic Touches: Incorporate subtle animations that respond to user input (e.g., color shifts based on mouse position), and avoid stock photos – use AI-generated but heavily edited images of diverse SMB scenarios.

**Form Styling (Audit Form):**
- Layout: Clean, single-column form with labels above inputs for accessibility.
- Inputs: Rounded borders, subtle shadows, and placeholders (e.g., "Tell us about your company's main activities").
- Button: Shiny green (#4CAF50 base with gradient to #66BB6A), all caps text, hover effect with glow (box-shadow) and scale animation.
- Validation: Front-end checks for required fields, with friendly error messages in a matching accent color.

## 6. Content and Copy Strategy
Focus on engaging, benefit-driven copy:
- Tone: Approachable, expert, enthusiastic – like a knowledgeable friend.
- Headlines: Punchy and unique (e.g., "AI That Vibes With Your Business" instead of "AI Solutions").
- SEO: Target keywords like "AI integration for small businesses," "custom AI prompts," "affordable AI app development."
- Calls to Action: "Let's Vibe on AI – Book a Free Consult."

## 7. Differentiation from Competitors
- Avoid AI-generated generic sites: Hand-craft elements, add personal stories.
- Stand Out: Emphasize "vibe" – emotional, intuitive AI use over pure tech.
- Metrics for Success: Track unique visitors, conversion rates, and feedback on uniqueness.

This plan provides a roadmap to a standout website. Iterate based on feedback during development.
